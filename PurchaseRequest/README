Usage:

The project uses a very simple maven layout. 
It does not use alfresco maven archetype and does not download the whole war application.
Instead it uses a dedicated alfresco installation that is configured via the pom's properties.
The resulting jar file is deployed using an antrun target, defined inside a profile and bundled to the install phase. 
It should do it's job.

A new artifact is created and deployed by executing 
mvn clean install

To produce an amp just modify the packaging type to amp. I did not do this because of the maven eclipse plugin.
I think that should be done by a separate artifact that depends on this one.
